# LSB Matching Revisited Steganography Project

This project demonstrates how to encode and decode messages using the **LSB Matching Revisited** method of **Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography**. This method improves upon traditional LSB steganography by reducing detectability and enhancing robustness through a matching technique. The hidden message can later be extracted and decoded from the image.

## Features

1. **Encode a Message**: Hide a secret message within an image using the LSB Matching Revisited technique.
2. **Decode a Message**: Extract the hidden message from an encoded image.
3. **Improved Robustness**: Enhances security by using the LSB Matching Revisited approach.
