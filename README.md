# LSB-Matching-Revisited
# LSB Steganography Project

This project demonstrates the use of Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography to hide and retrieve messages within an image. The encoding and decoding operations work by manipulating the least significant bits of the pixel values in an image to store the binary representation of the secret message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library for image processing

## Installation

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
